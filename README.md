# CS-3310-Database-Implementation
Introduction to the database management systems, database processing, data modeling, database design, development, and implementation. Contrasts alternative modeling approaches. Includes implementation of current DBMS tools and SQL

The purpose of this project was, given a set of tables, to identify both functional and multi-valued dependencies and to suggest a new reconstruction of the tables in such a manner as to comply with BCNF and 4NF.  Also, it was necessary to include a way to implement our new structure in an updateable database with a user friendly GUI interface to allow a user to modify and add to the existing database that was implemented.
